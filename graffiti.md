This is a free-for-all text file. The *.md file extension means that
it's a Markdown file. Markdown is a popular format for text editing,
as it has very simple formatting options. You can learn more about it
[here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

Markdown lets you use the extra formatting tools, but it also behaves
exactly like a *.txt file in that you can just write stuff in it if
that's what you feel like doing.

Here's some stuff you can do:
- Make stuff **bold** or *italic*
- Highlight `code`
- Put things into lists (ordered or unordered)
- And more

```
                                       (           
   (         (          (              )\ )   (    
   )\        )\ )  (    )\ )     (    (()/(   )\   
 (((_)  (   (()/( ))\  (()/(  (  )(    /(_))(((_)  
 )\___  )\   ((_))((_)  /(_)) )\(()\  (_))_ )\___  
((/ __|((_)  _| (_))   (_) _|((_)((_)  |   ((/ __| 
 | (__/ _ \/ _` / -_)   |  _/ _ \ '_|  | |) | (__  
  \___\___/\__,_\___|   |_| \___/_|    |___/ \___| 
                                                   
```

Yep.
