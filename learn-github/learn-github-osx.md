# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide assumes that you are a total newcomer (but,
hopefully, you know how to use a computer). We're not going to get too
in depth about anything, but should get you up and running with
everything you need to begin working. Once you're set up, you can then
[dive deeper](learning-resources.md) into any of the individual
areas. If you are already familiar with an aspect, feel free to skip
it.

This is the plan:

1.    [The Command Line](#the-command-line)
2.    [Working with git and Github](#working-with-git-and-github)
3.    [Editing!](#editing)
4.    [Making a Pull Request](#making-a-pull-request)

We're going to use those skills to edit this very repo! At the end,
you'll have your own personal ("local" is the jargon) copy of this
repo set up on your computer, allowing you to edit and explore
freely. Then, using pull requests, you'll propose a change to this
repo from changes you made to your personal copy. That might sound
fancy now, but we're going to walk through the whole process and make
it easy.

If something goes wrong along the way, use Google. Google is your
friend. Pasting in the error code should get you an explanation of
what went wrong and how to fix it. (Often, the answer will be
somewhere on Stack Overflow).

Okay, let's begin.

## The Command Line

On a Mac, open up your Terminal program. It should look something like
this:

![](./img/terminal-start.png)

### Traversing the CLI

This is your home directory (hence the little :house: up on top). In
command line terms, your home directory is notated as `~`. We're going
to use this interface to navigate your file structure and run some
commands. Here are the tools we'll use to do that:

`ls [directory]`: displays the contents of the directory specified (if
none specified, the current directory)

`cd [directory]`: changes to the directory specified (if none
specified, the home directory)

`mkdir [directory]`: creates a new directory

`touch [file]`: creates a file

`pwd`: shows you your location in the file system

We're going to need to tell these commands where to do things. Here's
how we do that:

The current directory is notated as `.`. The directory above that is
notated as `..`. For example, the structure of this repo is:

<pre>
    .
    &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; LICENSE.md
    &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; README.md
    &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; civic.json
    &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; further-reading.md
    &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; graffiti.md
    &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; learn-github
    &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; hello-world
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; hello-world.py
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x02514;&#x02500;&#x02500; hello-world.rb
    &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; img
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-forked-clone.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-forked-owner.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-pullrequest-approval.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-pullrequest-message.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-pullrequest-start.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-repo-fork.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-repo-issues.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; github-repo-owner.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02502;   &#x02514;&#x02500;&#x02500; terminal-start.png
    &#x02502;   &#x02514;&#x02500;&#x02500; learn-github-osx.md
    &#x02514;&#x02500;&#x02500; tools.md
</pre>

So, if I'm in the root of the directory and want to move to the `img`
folder, I type `cd img` or `cd ./img` into the terminal. I can then
run `ls` to see that `terminal-start.png` is in the current directory.

In all cases, the `tab` key is your friend. It will autocomplete
commands and paths and, if there are multiple options, it will show
you those options.

### Creating a Folder for Programming Stuff

It's useful to put all of your programming projects in one directory
(and it makes for a convenient exercise for our purposes), so let's
start with that.

First, let's take a look around the home directory, using `ls`.

    $ ls

You should see something like this:

    Applications    Desktop    Documents    Library    Movies    Music    Pictures    Public

Those are all of the directories you know and love from the file
explorer. To peek within any of them, simply enter `ls` followed by
the directory name. Give it a shot! Note that no matter how much you
`ls`, you return to the same directory for the next command; only `cd`
can move you around.

Now, you'll need to decide where in your file structure you'd like to
put it. This is a personal choice! Where it is doesn't matter so much
as you being able to easily locate it. I keep mine in a Dropbox-type
folder, so that my files sync across my devices. Other people might
want to put it in their `Documents` folder, or to just put it in the
home directory. Choose whatever works for you.

Once you've decided where to put the folder, we'll need to create
it. Use `mkdir` to do this, which will look something like this:

    $ mkdir Documents/Programming

Remember that the path will vary based on where you're putting the
folder. If you already tried some of those commands and are no longer
in the home directory, you can use the full path instead, like this:

    $ mkdir ~/Documents/Programming

### Making files

Now that you have this cool new folder, let's go check it out! If
you're not sure where you are, remember that you can use `pwd` to tell
you your location. If you're not in the home directory, you can change
to it with `cd` or `cd ~`. Using `cd`, change to your programming
folder. In our example, this would go like this:

    $ cd Documents/Programming

Remember that you can always go to the directory above the current one
by running `cd ..`. This directory is empty, so running `ls` here
won't return anything. Let's change that by creating a new file.

    $ touch hello-world.txt

That's it, you made a file! Now, let's write in that file. There are
two ways to go about this. First, you can open it in your default text
editor:

    $ open hello-word.txt

Second, you can use `echo` to add to it without even leaving the
CLI. `echo` is a command that does just that: echoes your input. Thus:

    $ echo 'hello world'
    hello world

By using `>`, we can redirect that output to the file. Thus:

    $ echo 'hello world' > hello-world.txt

Check the file and you'll see that it's true.

There are a few other commands that you may want to learn, like `rm`,
`cp`, `mv`, and `cat`, but you are now more than prepared for the next
step.

## Working with git and Github

In this step, you're going to set up a new command line program called
git, get running on Github, and create a local version of this repo to
work on.

Git is a piece of version control software. It allows you to work on
the same repository (a group of files, basically) as another person,
at the exact same time, without totally messing each other up. It does
this by grouping changes into `commits`, which you then `push` to the
central repo. You can only `push` if your local versions has all the
previous commits. So, if somebody else pushed commits since you last
checked, you must `pull` and `merge` those changes into your local
copy before you can `push` your new changes. Basically, it's a way to
make sure that your new changes are made to the most recent version of
the repo.

That might sound confusing, but it should become clearer as we walk
through the process. So, here we go.

### Installing git

Git is a program on your computer, so it needs to be installed. It's
not too hard: just go [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads), download
the latest version, and install it like any other program. If you'd
like to get fancy, you can install it using a package manager like
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), which makes installation as easy as
running `brew install git` on your command line. It's not strictly
necessary here, but it might make your life easier down the line.

Once you've installed git, you should check that everything worked
properly. In Terminal, run the command `git`; hopefully, you'll get a
brief view of all the options for the command.

### Using Github

As mentioned above, git works by holding a central repo of all of the
files, to which people push their changes. That repo has to live
somewhere that is accessible to all of those people, and Github is
often the service of choice. As you can tell, we're also using
Github. So, if you have a Github account, make sure you're logged
in. If you don't , go ahead and [sign up](https://github.com/join) and
walk through the configuration steps. Then, in order to communicate
with Github's servers, you should make sure that you have
[SSH keys set up](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
(this is the hardest step yet, but you can handle it).

Once you're set up with Github, look around this page (mostly near the
top) and you'll notice a few things.

First, the name of the repo and its owner. This is listed on the page,
as well as in the URL. Right below that, in the gray bar, you can
check out the commit history of the repo, which can show you which
change happened when. For example,
[in this repo](https://github.com/codefordc/guides/commits/master),
you can see that the
[first commit](https://github.com/codefordc/guides/commit/1b08f69b2fd5837af42dc12326bd9394414dfbe5)
included a few files, the
[second commit](https://github.com/codefordc/guides/commit/4fb3ad2022931b5a057f4ffe0061c832454ce4d1)
was a commit from a pull request, the
[third commit](https://github.com/codefordc/guides/commit/044f148863601491e1dce26f1f14dc25e4d513b0)
merged that commit from a fork of the repo into the Code for DC repo
(it might look confusing because @stvnrlly made both commits), and the
[fourth commit](https://github.com/codefordc/guides/commit/defc8390dce25e61236f350311e124d0bea80d48)
added screenshots and more text to this document.

![](./img/github-repo-owner.png)

Second, to the right of the code, the `Issues` and `Pull Requests`
tabs. Issues are for discussing ideas and problems with the
repo. Check out the
[issues for this repo](https://github.com/codefordc/guides/issues) to
see what we're discussing; maybe you can help resolve one of them!
Pull requests are how you ask to have your commits added to the repo,
which we'll cover once you've pushed some commits to your own version
of the repo.

![](./img/github-repo-issues.png)

Third, the `Fork` button up in the top right. If you don't have push
permissions for the repo (unless it's your repo or the owner has
granted you push access, you probably don't), the way to collaborate
on a repo is to fork it. This copies the repo and creates your own
separate version that you control. You can push commits to it as much
as you want without affecting the repo from which you forked it.

![](./img/github-repo-fork.png)

So, how do you add your code to the main repo? By making a pull
request. This tells the repo's owner that you'd like them to merge
some of your commits from your fork into the main repo. Before you do
that, though, you'll need to make some commits, and that means doing
some coding.

To work on the code, you'll need to get a local copy of the repo. Get
started by clicking that `Fork` button, which will take you to your
own special version of the repo. As you can see, this repo has the
full commit history of the repo you just forked, but it will not
include future changes without a pull request. If you go look at
[@stvnrlly's fork](https://github.com/stvnrlly/guides), for instance,
you'll see that it doesn't have any of the more recent commits to the
Code for DC repo, but it does have some commits unique to the fork.

![](./img/github-forked-owner.png)

Then, check down in the lower right side of the navbar. You'll see an
HTTPS or SSH `clone URL`.

![](./img/github-forked-clone.png)

Copy this and head back to the Terminal. There, all you have to do is
this:

    $ git clone [that clone URL you just copied]

A bunch of stuff will happen, and at the end of it you'll have a brand
new local copy of your forked repo, ready to be hacked on.

If you haven't done anything extra, your `Programming` folder should
now look something like this:

<pre>
    .
    &#x0251C;&#x02500;&#x02500; hello-world.txt
    &#x02514;&#x02500;&#x02500; guides
</pre>

We're going to work on the files in the `guides` directory, so go
ahead and `cd` into it.

## Editing!

In order to code, you'll probably want a text editor that understands
code. Some options include [TextMate](http://macromates.com/),
[Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/);
there are
[lots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors#Programming_features)
to choose from.

For our purposes, that's pretty much all you'll need. While we're
here, though, we might as well check that you have some of the major
programming languages installed on your machine. To do this, we're
going to run a couple of
["Hello World"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program)
programs, which we've already put in the repo. It should go something
like this:

    $ python learning/hello-world/hello-world.py
    Hello World! (in Python)
    $ ruby learning/hello-world/hello-world.rb
    Hello World! (in Ruby)

You can open those files up in your new text editor to see how that
happened.

Now, let's make some edits. Pick a file that you'd like to edit (or
make a new file) and open it in the editor. Feel free to edit anything
in the repo; if nothing strikes you, we've included the `graffiti.md`
file as a free-for-all text file.

Once you've made the edits and saved your work, it's time to do some
git magic. Start by checking the status of the repo:

    $ git status

You should get an overview of what files within the repo have been
changed. If you edited an existing file, you'll be told that there are
`Changes not staged for commit`. If you created a new file, you'll be
told that there are `Untracked files`. The message also lets you know
that you should `add` them to the staging area in order to commit
them. That's a good idea, so let's do it:

    $ git add [the file(s) you want to commit]

You can run `git add` as many times as you'd like before committing
the bundle of changes, as well as removing files from the staging area
with `git rm [file]`. After adding, run `git status` again, and you
should see that the file(s) are now ready to be committed. Great,
let's do that:

    $ git commit -m "message explaining what's in the commit"

Git requires that you include a message explaining the changes in the
commit; usually, a sentence or less should do the trick.

You can commit as many times as you'd like before pushing those
commits to the repo. A good practice is to group similar changes into
separate commits, as that will help make the changes clear to others
working on the repo (or your future self).

Ready to push? It's easy:

    $ git push origin master

In that command, `origin` refers to the version of the repo on Github,
and `master` refers to the branch of the repo. Branches are a whole
deeper and more awesome layer of git. `master` is usually the name of
the default branch and is a good place to keep the "live" version of
the repo, while other branches can be set up to develop features
(including commiting and pushing) that aren't ready to be incorporated
into that live version just quite yet.

Excellent! You have now edited your repo. Now it's time to request
that your changes be pulled back into the original Code for DC version
of the repo.

## Making a Pull Request

Back on the Github site, open up your fork of the repo. Remember that
`Pull Requests` tab over on the right? Well, now we're going to use
it. On that page, just click the `New pull request` button up on the
right. You'll end up here:

![](./img/github-pullrequest-start.png)

Github will automatically compare your repo against the Code for DC
repo. If everything outside of your committed changes is the same in
both repos (this might not be the case if somebody pushed a commit to
the file you're working on since you last pulled), Github will tell
you that the pull request can be automatically merged, which will help
the owner of the other repo. You can (and should) also enter a message
explaining what the commits in your pull request will do. Once you're
satisfied, hit `Create Pull Request`.

![](./img/github-pullrequest-message.png)

That's it! On the other side, your pull request will look like this:

![](./img/github-pullrequest-approval.png)

The owner might accept your request and merge the commits, discuss it
and perhaps ask for some changes to the commits, or decline to accept
it. You can monitor how up-to-date your fork is by checking out the
status bar right above the files:

![](./img/github-forked-status.png)

Now you're ready to take on a new challenge, either by finding a
[Code for DC project](codefordc.org/projects) to work on, or by
creating a new project to add to that list. Happy hacking!
